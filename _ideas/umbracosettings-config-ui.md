To have a friendlier UI for common options in the `umbracoSettings.config` file.

We could have things like...

* A text field for the [email notifications](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/reference/config/umbracosettings/#notifications)
* Content Pickers for the [`<error404>` page](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/reference/config/umbracosettings/#errors)
* Checkboxes for various on/off switches

More details about the [`umbracoSettings.config` file are available on the Our Umbraco documenation](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/reference/config/umbracosettings/).
