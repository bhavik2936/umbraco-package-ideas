* [ ] Uptime monitor - using [UptimeRobot API](https://github.com/cmaneu/UptimeRobot-.net-API-Client)
* [x] ~~Maintenance Mode - dashboard control that takes your IP address and enables [a HttpModule to take your website "offline"](http://blog.dreamlabsolutions.com/post/2009/09/02/Take-an-ASPNET-Application-offline-with-HttpModules.aspx)~~
  * @kgiszewski developed [Bouncer](https://github.com/imulus/Bouncer) - HttpModule for redirecting non-authorized users to a static HTML page.
* [ ] Website Verification Services - inspired by [WordPress.com's tools](http://support.wordpress.com/webmaster-tools/); have fields for verifying your website against: Google, Bing, Pinterest, Twitter and Yandex.
