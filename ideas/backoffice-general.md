# Umbraco back-office ideas

* [ ] Web console - using a [jQuery console](https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console) emulator with [Roslyn](https://github.com/fekberg/Roslyn-Hosted-Execution). Similar idea to [NetBash](https://github.com/lukencode/NetBash), but Umbraco specific.
  * e.g. a console for executing select queries in the back office - think sql management studio for umbraco nodes.
  * similar concepts: [ShellR](http://pieterderycke.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/shellr-a-web-based-powershell-running-on-azure/), [ConsolR](http://blog.appharbor.com/2012/05/30/introducing-consolr), [Sitecore Revolver](http://www.codeflood.net/revolver/)
* [ ] Pushover Notifications - inspired by [a WordPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pushover-notifications/) using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) API.
* [ ] [heyoffline.js](http://oskarkrawczyk.github.com/heyoffline.js/) - If a content editor is working on a fragile internet connection, this plugin could warn them when their network goes down. Make sure they don't lose anything. (Maybe save to localStorage?)
* [ ] Code snippets (Razor, XSLT) powered by GitHub Gists.
* [ ] [ClippyJS](http://www.smore.com/clippy-js) - A fun, but joke project. Actions interact with user functions, e.g. publish, delete, errors, etc.
* [ ] [Piecon](http://lipka.github.com/piecon/) - Pie charts in your favicon! Could be used for media uploads? Useful for if uploading large files and user doesn't have browser focus (minimised or on different tab)
* [ ] [Tinycon](http://tommoor.github.com/tinycon/) - similar to Piecon, but for displaying notification numbers. (Unsure of how to target Umbraco, still interesting tech).
* [ ] Achievements/gamification of the back-office - get badges when tasks are unlocked; e.g. "Congrats, you have climbed 'Rollback Mountain'"
* [ ] [Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) - data visualisations; e.g. what times of day is content entered?
* [ ] Using [wwwsqldesigner](https://code.google.com/p/wwwsqldesigner/) as a Document Type Visualiser.
